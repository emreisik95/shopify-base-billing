#### GET API Keys
On the same page that you set the redirect URLs, you can find the app credentials.  You will get the `API Key` and the `API Secret Key`. We will use these  when we set the environenment variables in the next step.

# Important Gems Used
## Shopify App
This gem includes a Rails Engine and generators for writing Rails applications using the Shopify API. The Engine provides a SessionsController and all the required code for authenticating with a shop via Oauth (other authentication methods are not supported).

- Documentation: http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/shopify_app/8.2.5

## Shopify API
The Shopify API gem allows Ruby developers to programmatically access the admin section of Shopify stores.

The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Order, Product, or Collection, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.
